On-the-fly SfM: running online SfM while image capturing!
Similar to conventional SfM, On-the-fly SfM yields image poses and 3D sparse points, but we do this while the image capture. More specifically, the current imageâ€™s pose and corresponding 3D points can be estimated before next image is captured and on-the-fly to be processed, i.e., what you capture is what you get.
